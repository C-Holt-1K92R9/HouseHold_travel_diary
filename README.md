My First official project that was utilized for a research research.

**About**
This project is purely constructed with HTML, CSS, PHP and MYSWQL.
A survey was being done for a Thesis and this is the web-based survey form for the survey, which is specificly made for this theisis research.

Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the web-based survey management system designed for efficient data collection and administration. The system operates through two distinct user roles: the Surveyor, who is responsible for field data entry via a user interface that communicates with a central Web Server, and the admin, who possesses comprehensive oversight privileges. Data submitted by surveyors, including consent forms, household information, member details, travel history, and vehicle data, is processed by the web server and stored in a structured Database. A critical security feature of this design is that surveyors can only view and modify the data that they have personally collected, ensuring strict data segregation between field agents. In contrast, the admin can manage surveyor accounts, view all submitted data, monitor the overall survey status, export data as CSV, and review bug reports. This architecture establishes a clear, role-based workflow with robust access controls, ensuring data integrity from collection to analysis while facilitating system maintenance through user feedback channels.
